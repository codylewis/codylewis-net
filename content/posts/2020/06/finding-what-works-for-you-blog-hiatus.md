## Howdy stranger

Just like there are seasons in the year, there are seasons in one's life and career. Priorities are always shiftings and goals become a moving target.

This is pertinent to this blog because it used to be a platform to facilitate what my priorities and goals were last year. But then all of the sudden... it stopped.

## Alternatives

> I've stopped blogging as a means to facilitate learning.

If I heard that from a colleague I might be a little concerned.

> Instead of blogging, I"m going to focus on meetups, reading, and other mediums to faciltate my learnings.

Now that, I wouldn't bat an eye at. Granted that's the approach that I've been taking the past year so I'm a little bias.

Granted with the current climate of the world physical meetups have turned into webinars and virtual gatherings but it gets the job done.

## Public Service Annoucement

This post is a short one and that's intentional.

I'm going to continue on the path I've pivoted to since last year and revisit writing on here when that makes sense.

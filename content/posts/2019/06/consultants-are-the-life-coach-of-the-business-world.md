## What is Consultant?

> One who gives professional advice or services[^1]

> A person who counsels and encourages clients on matters having to do with careers or personal challenges.[^2]

I'd say both of those are pretty spot on definitions. But one of them isn't the definition of a consultant, it's the definition of a life coach.

Consulting boils down to helping clients. They're almost always going to need the technical expertise you have to offer but all of the value you provide wasn't written in the statement of work.

## How We Work?

You have expertise in front-end technologies such as MVC, jQuery and Bootstrap. The clients hires you to help fast track their new web application because you check the technical boxes needed and they felt good with the brief phone interview they had with you.

Fast-forward to day one at the clients and your technical expertise is coming in handy in leaps in bounds. They're instantly seeing the value in brining an expert in but that doesn't mean you're going to stop helping them.

Team dynamics, workflow, workplace moral -- some of these may already be a well oiled machine but if they're not you're not going to let that slip by. You're here to counsel them on how things could be better. Whether that's directly through setting up a build pipeline or more subtle like shouting out the great collaboration team members did in a past sprint. 

Each consultant is going to operate differently and each client is going to have different needs. How each situation plays out will change but the core of making the client better will always remain.

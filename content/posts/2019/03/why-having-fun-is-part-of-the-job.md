Deadlines, overtime and other stressors seem to be as commonplace in the workplace as much today as they were in the past. How can the individual employee mitigate these woes and look toward tomorrow with a smile?

It's simple, have fun at your job.

## You're the Catalyst

While easier said than done, it starts with *you*. Whether you're a manager, C-level executive or a regular employee -- you're the catalyst for change. (Cody, you need a long dash here, connected, like below.)

I'm not going to tell you how to have fun because what's fun for one person is a chore for the other. I'll instead delve into the benefits you and your coworkers will have.

## Why Bother?

### Make yourself healthier

> Unhappiness can be painful—literally.[^1]

Happiness, a complementary associate of fun, proves to have tremendous health benefits. Strengthening your immune system and helping to combat stress are two great takeaways that have an almost immediate impact in your day-to-day life.[^1]

### Promote creativity[^2]

We've all been in environments that have this stifling air in them. They make you feel the need to keep to yourself and not disturb the status quo. Being able to have fun is the exact opposite.

It creates openness to let ideas flow freely. It stimulates ideas and inspires a sense of collaboration among others.

### What's the point in doing something if you're not having fun?

For me, nothing (within reason).

I'm not talking about tax returns or jury duty. But seriously, what's the point of doing something you don’t enjoy?

If you don't like where you work, strive to improve things there, or if need be, find a better job elsewhere. Move, don’t mope. When you love your job, everything else seems to fall into place. It’s like being love, with employee benefits.  So, be the catalyst for change.

Whatever your situation, you have the power to make things better. Take charge.

For instance, the next time you're  talking to a recruiter, ask them this: "Is having fun part of the job?"

If the question stumps or the recruiter, or worse, leaves him nonplussed, then that’s probably not the response--or job--you want. Says thanks and move on.

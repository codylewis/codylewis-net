Deadlines, overtime, and other stressors seem to be commonplace in the workplace just as much today as they were in the past. How can the individual employee mitigate these woes and look towards tomorrow with a smile.

It's simple, have fun at your job.

## You're the Catalyst

It's easier said than done but it starts with *you*. Whether you're a manager, C-level execute or a regular employee -- you're the catalyst for change.

I'm not going to tell you how to have fun because what's fun for one person is a chore for the other. I'll instead delve into the benefits you and your coworkers find will have.

## Why Bother?

### Make yourself healthier

> Unhappiness can be painfulâ€”literally.[^1]

Happiness, a complementary associate of fun, has been proven to have tremendous health benefits. Strengthening your immune system and helping to combat stress are two great takeaways that have almost immediate impact in day to day life.[^1]

### Promote creativity[^2]

We've all been in environments that have this stifling air in them. They make you feel the need to keep to yourself and not disturb the status quo. Being able to have fun is the exact opposite.

It creates openness to let ideas flow freely. It stimulates ideas and inspires a sense of collaboration between others.

### What's the point in doing something if your not having fun?

For me, nothing (within reason).

I'm not talking about tax returns or jury duty. What's the point of doing something you do not have to do if you not enjoying it?

If you don't like where you work, strive to improve and find a better job. Love you job and everyone else seems to be low? Be the catalyst for change.

Whatever your situation, you have the power to change it for the better.

The next time you're looking for a job and talking to a recruiter, ask them this, "Is having fun part of the job?".

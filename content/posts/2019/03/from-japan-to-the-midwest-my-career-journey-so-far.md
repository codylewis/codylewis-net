## 2015

This wasn't mentioned in the title but I'm not from Japan or the Midwest. I'm from Texas and that's where this story begins.

At the time I had recently broken up my girlfriend and I was waiting tables in a restaurant as I had done for the past 2 years. I had dabbled in programming courses online but hasn't stuck with it to a measurable degree.

My life didn't seem to be taking the direction I wanted it to go in... cue soul searching trip.

## 86 Days

Jan 14, 2015, 2:18 AM.

At that point I had a ticket booked for Japan leaving Aug 18, 2015 and returning Nov 12, 2015.

> **TOURIST VISA REQUIRED:**
>
> Not required for stays of less than 90 days[^1]

Luckily, or more so calculated, my trip was for 86 days. Did I mention I bought the ticket before making any plans for the actual trip?

## The Plan or Lack There Of

There was some thought put into this trip before the ticket was booked:

1. I've always wanted to travel to Japan
1. I'd travel solo
1. I'd be a WWOOFer

The first two are self explanatory but the last item requires more explanation.

> WorldWide Opportunities on Organic Farms, (WWOOF) is part of a worldwide movement linking visitors with organic farmers and growers to promote cultural and educational experiences based on trust and non-monetary exchange thereby helping to build a sustainable global community.

Basically, I'd be working on a farm as a means to explore the country and figure things out. Not too bad right?

## The Actual Plan

After a few months of planning the trip itinerary went like this.

Start in Tokyo and do all things I've always wanted to do in Japan. Work on six different farms, visiting Kyoto in the middle of them, and circle back around to Tokyo before heading home.

## Fast Forward to the First Farm

After a train ride to Tokyo, I found myself at the family's farm in a quiet suburb. A warm welcome, meal, and night's sleep later we took a 45 minute drive to their farm. Surprising right?

Day one was easy enough. Hideo-san and I organized the shed where the harvesting crates and farm equipment resided. This was followed by weed whacking for a few hours in the afternoon.

Day two was something else entirely. Eight hour of weed whacking and hornet removal. It was in hour five when I a realization.

If I didn't get life together, my life would turn into the metaphorical equivalent of eight hours of weed whacking. Every. Day.

## Revaluating Things

That evening I sent an email to a some close friends, here's a snippet that summarizes it general sentiment.

> Agriculture is not a career option, I'm almost 100% positive this will be my last farm I go to. It's not that I'm not enjoying it, but I know that I won't enjoy it after 2 weeks.
>
> So that's leads into my next post, I've decided to go forward with learning either web design or programming.

And that's what I did.

I changed my return flight at 5am the next morning and headed to Kyoto to begin the remainder of my trip.

<!-- Talk about Mt. Fuji? -->

## Coming Back State Side

After a quick trip to store to buy myself a desk, monitor, and computer, my entire existence was devoted to learning the web development.

Night life, social life, any life outside of learning and progression didn't exist for the first few months. I started simple on sites like [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) and expanded into more advanced ones such as [Frontend Master](https://frontendmasters.com/).

I was steadily progressing and my dedication would soon pay off.

## My First Invoice

My first invoice was dated on November 14, 2015. 70 days from when I got back back from Japan.

The work was handling the HTML and CSS aspects of an online application, and I had been fortunate in the opportunity.

## Internship

Because of the work I accomplished as a freelance agent, I was soon offered an internship with the company for with a three month time span starting January 1, 2016.

Within these three month, the work was the same as I had done before but my responsibilities began to grow over time.

Fast word to a couple months later, and I was offered a full-time position. Less than 6 months from when my plane first touched down on the tarmac my hard work and dedication was continuing to pay off.

I consider myself fortunate that the opportunities were available when they were but I earned them myself.

## Full Time Employment

My day to day didn't change much if all once I found myself a full time employee. For the next few months I continued build the application I began during my freelance work.

The application was an online sign in for a local walk-in clinic. The goal being to eliminate wait times in person so enable people to have an expedited visit when the physician was ready to see them.

When the project began, the scope was simple enough. Capture basic fields relevant to the patient, their insurance, etc. Once the ball got rolling, there was a feature request to help automate the process further. By allowing a driver's license to be scanned all available fields will be automatically filled by the information provided -- can't beat that.

This request came months after I had accepted the full time position and over time I was given additional responsibilities. When it came time to implement this, I had almost entirely full reign.

Once work had began I was tasked with implementation as well coordinating development with a fellow developer overseas. I was at my growing edge through this entire time, failing, learning, and ultimately succeeding.

Fast forward to a year later and it was time for the application to expand yet again. Patient doctors visit through video conference. That was the ideas and a daunting development task at this stage in my career. I had assistance in the beginning with some of the design, but I soon found myself in a position other wouldn't find themselves in for years.

While this part of my career was some of the most challenging, it was also most rewarding. I'd worked with technologies such as WebRTC for the video feed and services such as Pusher to design a chat application for the providers. I might've been on my growing edge yet again, but this project was on the bleeding edge of technology at the time. Our releases coincided with Safari updates on macOS and iOS, an interesting restriction at the time.

## I Met a Girl

This is relevant to the story, so stick with me.

You find what you're looking for when you least expect it, and what happened when I met my girlfriend Cassie. A vivacious women from the Midwest currently enrolled Baylor at Dallas in their nursing program.

When we first met she told me where she was from and pointed to the mitten[^2] on the map. I didn't think less than two years later that we'd find ourselves back in her home state -- funny how life works.

## Miles Away But Still Connected, Working Remotely

I was fortunate during my transition to Wisconsin that I was able to take my previous position and work remotely. My responsibilities continued to grow and I was still challenged daily by different opportunities -- being remote didn't change that.

Being new to a city, something that did change was how I was spending my free time. Since I didn't know anyone in the area and I heard great thing about the developer community in Milwaukee, I headed to Meetup.com to get involved.

There were established groups like MilwaukeeJS, Laravel Milwaukee, and Wisconsin .Net Users Group that proudly representing their individual community on a regular basis, but there was one new and smaller group that caught my attention.

## Milwaukee Hacker Hours

## 2015

This wasn't mentioned in the title but I'm not from Japan or the Midwest. I'm from Texas and that's where this story begins.

At the time I had recently broken up my girlfriend and I was waiting tables in a restaurant as I had done for the past 2 years. My life didn't seem to be taking the direction I wanted it to go in... cue soul searching trip.

## 86 Days

Jan 14, 2015, 2:18 AM.

At that point I had a ticket booked for Japan leaving Aug 18, 2015 and returning Nov 12, 2015.

> **TOURIST VISA REQUIRED:**
>
> Not required for stays of less than 90 days[^1]

Luckily, or more so calculated, my trip was for 86 days. Did I mention I bought the ticket before making any plans for the actual trip?

## The Plan or Lack There Of

<!-- Solo travel -->
<!-- Always wanted to travel to Japan -->
<!-- Farm -->
<!-- Not a fit for me -->

## 2015

This wasn't mentioned in the title but I'm not from Japan or the Midwest. I'm from Texas and that's where this story begins.

At the time I had recently broken up my girlfriend and I was waiting tables in a restaurant as I had done for the past 2 years. My life didn't seem to be taking the direction I wanted it to go in... cue soul searching trip.

## 86 Days

Jan 14, 2015, 2:18 AM.

At that point I had a ticket booked for Japan leaving Aug 18, 2015 and returning Nov 12, 2015.

> **TOURIST VISA REQUIRED:**
>
> Not required for stays of less than 90 days[^1]

Luckily, or more so calculated, my trip was for 86 days. Did I mention I bought the ticket before making any plans for the actual trip?

## The Plan or Lack There Of

There was some thought put into this trip before the ticket was booked:

1. I've always wanted to travel to Japan
1. I'd travel solo
1. I'd be a WWOOFer

The first two are self explanatory but the last item requires more explanation.

> WorldWide Opportunities on Organic Farms, (WWOOF) is part of a worldwide movement linking visitors with organic farmers and growers to promote cultural and educational experiences based on trust and non-monetary exchange thereby helping to build a sustainable global community.

Basically, I'd be working on a farm as a means to explore the country and figure things out. Not too bad right?

## The Actual Plan

After a few months of planning the trip itinerary went like this.

Start in Tokyo and do all things I've always wanted to do in Japan. Work on six different farms, visiting Kyoto in the middle of them, and circle back around to Tokyo before heading home.

## Fast Forward to the First Farm

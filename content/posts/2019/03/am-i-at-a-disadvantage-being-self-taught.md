## No

No you are not but there's more to the question than a simple yes or no answer.

<!-- Touch on how having a degree isn't better or worse either here? -->
<!-- Not sure how / if to approach this -->

## Define Self-taught

I consider myself self-taught and to me that means I don't have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or some another relevant field. I consider myself self-taught because I learned how to program online from excellent courses on  [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) and [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) with no formal experience before then.

## So Why?

So why are you not at a disadvantaged as a self-taught programmer then? Here's just a few likely candidates:

1. You're a self-starter
1. You don't give up three
1. You're reading this blog post

Programming isn't the hardest occupation in the world but it certainly isn't easy. Being able to start into this vast landscape of code and computers takes certain qualities that tell future employers, clients, and fellow developers the kind of person you are.

You're the kind of person who doesn't give up and continues to grow. Anyone can start something and anyone can learn something. Few people start something, learn something *and* continue to try improve when others would get comfortable. This isn't exclusive to the self-taught individual but be proud that you apart of this minority.

## Self-taught is Better Then?

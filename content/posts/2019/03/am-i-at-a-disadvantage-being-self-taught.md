## No

No, you are not but there's more to the question than a simple yes or no answer.

<!-- Touch on how having a degree isn't better or worse either here? -->
<!-- Not sure how / if to approach this -->

## So Why?

So why are you not at a disadvantaged as a self-taught programmer then? Here's a few, but not all, reasons:

1. You're a self-starter.
1. You don't give up.
1. You're reading this blog post.

Programming isn't the hardest occupation in the world but it certainly isn't easy. Being able to venture into the vast landscape of code and computers takes certain qualities that tell future employers, clients, and fellow developers the kind of person you are.

You're the kind of person who doesn't give up and continues to grow. Anyone can start something and anyone can learn something. Few people start something, learn something *and* continue to try improve when others would get comfortable. This isn't exclusive to the self-taught individual but be proud that you apart of this minority.

## What Have You Done And What Are You Doing?

Learning how to program is great but it isn't enough to get your foot in the door. This knowledge needs to be applied to projects and used to assist others to hone your skill.

Are you doing any of the following?

1. Contributing to open source projects
1. Involving yourself in local meetups
1. Volunteering with local schools, non-profits
1. Writing or speaking as a means to share your expertise

If you aren't, why?

While it's great to be comfortable in life, I don't think it's alright to be complacent. Whether you're self-taught or self-employed, I dare say you'll never regret the time you put into something if you truly wanted to be there.

## So You're Saying It's Better to be Self-taught?

No, not one bit. No path is life is "better" than another, everyone's is individual are theirs to forge.

I myself am envious of those with Bachelor's Degrees in Computer Science but because I don't have one doesn't make me right or wrong. All anyone can do is strive to be a better version of themselves while taking the time to celebrate their successes along th way.

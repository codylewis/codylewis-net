## Sprint Review

The team just finished the presenting the work done the past sprint. There's been some feedback and comments.

> Oh, that's look good.

> It's nice that it works on phones now.

It is feedback and it could be better but it's not anyone's fault except the team. It's the team's job to get everyone in the review comfortable and primed to give feedback through the meeting.

Easier said than done but there are a few small things that can be done that have huge returns once all is said and done.
